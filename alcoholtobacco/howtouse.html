<p><strong> Options panel (left):</strong></p>

<p>You’ll see some options to the left of the map – Local Authorities, Enter an Area of Interest, Data Type, Year, Typical Distance to Outlet (m) and Rank Colour Options. When the website is first loaded you will be prompted on whether you would like to share your location, if you accept the map will zoom to your current IP location (with a blue marker diplayed on your predicted location). If not, or you would prefer to look at another area, then you can use the first two options on the options panel to locate an area on the map that you are interested in. In the "Local Authorities" option box you can choose from one to five of the 32 local authorites, or the whole of Scotland. If it is a specific local area then it might be better to type in an address to the "Enter an Area of Interest" box and press Enter. By specifying the location of the map in any of these three ways you will then be presented with the default options for the data- Data Type="Alcohol Total Sales", Year="2016", Typical Distance to Outlet (m)="800" and Rank Colour Options="Compared to Scottish Average". You are then able to change these options to dynamically display the data in different ways. For full information on the options see the 'About' tab. If you get stuck whilst using the application then hover over the option boxes with your cursor, to get some information instantly.</p>

<p><strong>Using the map:</strong></p>

<p>When you have selected the geography and data type then you can explore the map using the map options in the corners of the map. In the bottom left hand corner is the scale bar which will change dynamically as you zoom. In the right hand corner is the Colour Rank, with red signifying a high density, yellow an average density and blue a low density, with the choice of comparison based on the option specified in the "Rank Colour Options" box. In the top left hand corner is the + and - zoom options, so that you can pan around the map to different areas. Below these is the full screen option, which we recommend using for taking screenshots of the maps. On the top right of the map is the basemap options, this includes some well known layers including CartoDB Positron designed by Stamen, Toner designed by Stamen and Open Street Map (OSM).</p>

<p><em><strong>*****TO BE UPDATED*****</strong></em></p>

<p>When a neighbourhood has been highlighted yellow on the map (by clicking) a text box will appear under the map to give more information about the neighbourhood, and how it compares with the rest of the Local Authority and Scotland on each of the measures (see image below for what it should look like).  Outlet availability is measured as <u>density (per km<sup>2</sup>) within a 10-minute walk (800 m)<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><u>[2]</u></a></u> of the neighbourhood’s population centre.  It is not the number of outlets within each datazone – such a measure wouldn’t be comparable between neighbourhoods because they differ in size so widely, and would also be artificially constrained by the neighbourhood boundaries in a way that residents aren’t in real life.</p>

<p><strong>Using the download facility:</strong></p>

The map is useful for looking at the stats for a single neighbourhood (datazone S01002070 in this case, as shown in the text box) and seeing the general patterns of outlet density, health and deprivation in the surrounding area, but what if you want to look at the data in greater depth, for example to find out how that neighbourhood ranks against others?  To do this you can download the data for the area of interest, or the whole of Scotland:·
<ul>
	<li>Click on ‘DATA DOWNLOAD’ and enter your contact information (used by us confidentially to find out how the data are being used)·</li>
	<li>Click ‘Get Data’·</li>
	<li>Select ‘Whole of Scotland’ or ‘Selected Local Authorities’ or ‘Selected Scottish Parliamentary Constituencies’·</li>
	<li>Choose relevant area(s), if applicable</li>
</ul>
A spreadsheet will download, containing information about the dataset (‘Sheet 0’), Abbreviations and definitions (‘Sheet 1’), the data (‘Sheet 2’), and descriptions of the data columns (‘Sheet 3’). The spreadsheet is in Microsoft Excel format (.xlsx) but can also be opened in other programs such as OpenOffice.org’s free Calc program (go to <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/" target="_blank">http://www.openoffice.org/</a> to download).

If we download the data for the City of Edinburgh Local Authority we get the data for all 549 datazones in Sheet 2.  For ease of navigating around the data it is worth clicking on cell B3, then on ‘View’ > ‘Split’ in Excel (or ‘Window’>’Split’ in older versions of Excel or Open Office.org’s Calc program), so that the column headings and datazone codes are always visible.  Then we can scroll down to the neighbourhood (=datazone) we are interested in (S01002070), and highlight it for ease of remembering where it is.  Scrolling across the data columns informs us that, out of all 549 neighbourhoods in Edinburgh, this neighbourhood has the 53<sup>rd</sup> highest density of alcohol outlets, the 46<sup>th</sup> highest density of tobacco outlets, and the 51<sup>st</sup> highest rate of alcohol-related deaths.

But which are the highest ranking neighbourhoods?  Don’t try to sort the data in the outlet density columns as it’s in text format, and the sort will produce strange results.  But the rank columns are numeric so do sort properly.  Select row 2 (column headings) and select ‘Data’ > ‘Filter’ (or ‘Data’>’Filter’>’Auto-filter’ in Calc). Click on the small filter button (downward pointing triangle) in the column of interest (e.g., LA ranks of on-sales outlet density, column AJ2) and select ‘Sort smallest to largest’ or ‘Top 10’.  The top-ranked datazones will now be at the top of the spreadsheet.  This shows us that datazone S01002117 is top ranking for on-sales outlet density, then datazones S01002106, S01002131, S01002108 and S01002118 are 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup>, respectively.  But where are these other datazones?

Searching by datazone code is not currently possible within the webmap, so the best way to find out where these datazones are located is to use Scottish Neighbourhood Statistics, at <a href="http://www.sns.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.sns.gov.uk</a>.  Just enter the datazone code in ‘Quick Profile’, and select ‘Maps’.  The datazone with the highest density of on sales outlets – in both Edinburgh and Scotland – is in the Grassmarket area.  The other top-ranked datazones are also centrally located.

<strong>Footnotes:</strong>

<a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Here neighbourhoods are ‘datazones’: see <a href="http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2005/02/20697/52626" target="_blank">http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2005/02/20697/52626</a> for more info

<a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Because the area covered by an 800 m (approximately 10 minute walk) circle around the neighbourhood’s population centre is actually 2 km<sup>2</sup>, the <u>density</u> value per km<sup>2</sup> (shown in the text box) can be doubled to give the <u>number</u> of outlets within 800 m.  For example, the neighbourhood we have highlighted here has a tobacco outlet density of 32.3 outlets per km<sup>2</sup> within 800 m of its population centre, and this is equivalent to a count of 64.6 (=65) outlets within this same distance.
