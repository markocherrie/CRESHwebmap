<p><strong> Getting started </strong></p>

<p>To the left of the map, several option boxes are located – 'Local Authorities', 'Enter an Area of Interest', 'Data Type', 'Year', 'Typical Distance to Outlet (metres)' and 'Rank Colour Options'. When the website is first loaded you will be prompted on whether you would like to share your location, if you accept the map will zoom to your current IP location (with a blue marker diplayed on your predicted location). If not, or if you would prefer to look at another area, then you can use the first two options on the options panel to locate an area on the map that you are interested in. In the "Local Authorities" option box you can choose from one to five of the 32 local authorites, or the whole of Scotland. If it is a specific local area then it might be better to type in an address to the "Enter an Area of Interest" box and click the Enter icon. By specifying the location of the map in any of these three ways you will then be presented with the default options for the data- Data Type="Alcohol Total Sales", Year="2016", Typical Distance to Outlet (m)="800" and Rank Colour Options="Compared to Scottish Average". You are then able to change these options to dynamically display the data in different ways. For full information on the options see the 'About' tab. If you get stuck whilst using the application then hover over the option boxes with your cursor, to get some information instantly.</p>

<p><strong> Understanding the map </strong></p>

<p>When you have selected the geography and data type then you can explore the map using the map options in the corners of the map. In the bottom left hand corner is the scale bar which will change dynamically as you zoom. In the right hand corner is the Colour Rank, with red signifying a high density, yellow an average density and blue a low density, with the choice of comparison based on the option specified in the "Rank Colour Options" box. In the top left hand corner is the + and - zoom options, so that you can pan around the map to different areas. Below these is the full screen option, which we recommend using for taking screenshots of the maps. On the top right of the map is the basemap options, this includes some well known layers including CartoDB Positron designed by Stamen, Toner designed by Stamen and Open Street Map (OSM). Hovering over a neighbourhood will turn the boundary black. By clicking a neighbourhood a text box will appear containing information on outlet density, health and crime. This neighbourhood's statistics will be compared to others based on the option selected for "Rank Colour Options" (e.g. Scotland, Local authority, SIMD group or urban/rural group). Note than the outlet availability is measured as density (per km<sup>2</sup>) within a certain distance (determined by "typical distance to outlet (metres)" option) from the neighbourhood’s population centre. It is not the number of outlets within each datazone – such a measure wouldn’t be comparable between neighbourhoods because they differ in size so widely, and would also be artificially constrained by the neighbourhood boundaries in a way that residents aren’t in real life</p>
    
<p><strong> Downloading the data</strong></p>

The map is useful for looking at the stats for a single neighbourhood and seeing the general patterns of outlet density, health and crime in the surrounding area, but what if you want to look at the data in greater depth, for example to find out how that neighbourhood ranks against others?  To do this you can download the data for the area of interest:·
<ul>
	<li>Click on ‘Register to Download’ tab and enter your contact information (used by us confidentially to find out how the data are being used)</li>
	<li>Click the ‘Submit’ icon</li>
	<li>Click on the 'Download' tab and the data will be visible (note that if you have selected an option in the 'local authorities' box the data will be filtered to this local authority)</li>
	<li>Use the Search box to filter the data further, for example all the datazones containing 'Culter'</li>
    <li>Scroll to the bottom of the table and the click on the 'Download Filtered Data' icon. Note that it this is greyed out then it might indicate that you have not registered to download</li>
</ul>
A spreadsheet will download, containing the data. A description of the data columns is below:

<ul>
	<li>DZ_2011_code = Datazone 2011 code</li>
    <li>DZ_2011_name = Datazone 2011 name</li>
    <li>IZ_2011_code = Intermediate Zone 2011 code</li>
    <li>IZ_2011_name = Intermediate Zone 2011 name</li>
    <li>LA_code = Local Authority code</li>
    <li>LA_name = Local Authority name</li>
    <li>X------ = X columns represent the outlet availability data and are structured as follows: "X", Typical distance to outlet, data type and then either count or density </li>
    <li>TobMortSMR_2011_2015 = Tobacco related deaths, see 'About' tab </li>
    <li>AlcMortSMR_2011_2015 = Alcohol related deaths, see 'About' tab </li>
    <li>UR6_2013_2014 = Scottish Government's Urban/rural 6 fold classification </li>
    <li>SIMD_2016_AlcHosp = Scottish Government's SIMD 2016 Hospital stays related to alcohol misuse indicator, see 'About' tab </li>
    <li>SIMD_2016_income = Scottish Government's SIMD 2016 income indicator (quintiles) </li>
    <li>SIMD_2016_crime = Scottish Government's SIMD 2016 crime indicator, see 'About' tab </li>
</ul>

The spreadsheet is in comma-seperated values format (.csv) and can also be opened in several programs such as Microsoft Excel and OpenOffice.org’s free Calc program (go to <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/" target="_blank">http://www.openoffice.org/</a> to download).
